      <p>STEP 2: Create an account in the Kaidro website. Now for this step you need to have a ronin wallet. I've placed a direct link to a tutorial how to create
        a ronin wallet below. Once you have a ronin wallet go to Kaidro.com. Click the "Free journal mint" at the buttom right of your screen. Follow the prompts and wait as minting may
      take some time. Once that's done you congratulations you are now part of the kaidro universe. </p>

      <p>There are currently 4 NFTs. The journal, sparksuits, spirit guardians, and pilots. The journal you can mint for free. 
        It’s meant to be a low cost, basic entry  point to the entire IP. You mint it. You enter the website. There you can read the entire comics
        participate in events and interact with the entire intellectual property (IP). It's like their very own xbox live
        <p>
          Paid NFTs (Sparksuits, spirit guardians and Pilots) act as premium access to the entire IP. It will give you access to airdrops of future 
          whitelists. Early access to everything Kaidro. Currently there are 9,999 Sparksuits and 15,000 Spirit guardians. We know that the Pilots will be less. 
          Click the buttons provided to see these collections. Each NFT has a set of traits that are combined to produce truly unique NFTs. 
        In terms of utility, NFTs when combined in a certain way will give you points. You will be given $KDR in proportion to your points
        in a ranked leaderboard system. Details will be given in a separate section of this website. Go to the main menu.

      <p> $KDR is the native token. We know that it will play a part in the mint of the third NFT the Pilots. It will also be used to buy synergy slots 
        to partipate in Synergy and $KDR aidrop. As of now, these are the only known use cases for KDR. $KDR is set to be released in September 2024. A Fixed amount will be airdropped
        to NFT holders (sparksuits, spirit guardians, collectible journals and possibly Pilots) and the rest of the KDR will be distributed monthly based on leaderboard placements. To know
