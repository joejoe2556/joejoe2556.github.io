a one of a kind intellectual property

That has three components

a comic, a game

and an animated series

Now all these are meant

to take its consumers 

on a fully immersive experience

across an ever-expanding universe

The lore is set on the beautiful world of T'aljor

It is shrouded in the mists of ancient magic

 and technological wonders.

In this world, Gaia is the deity and there are 2 races. 

 
The Trakarians and K'ailantians. 

The K'ailantians: are revered for their 

innate connection to astral powers, 

granting them unparalleled abilities to manipulate the forces of the cosmos.

They are like guardians of ancient wisdom

and custodians of  spiritual balance within T'aljor.

In contrast, the Trakarians have dedicated themselves to the

  pursuit of knowledge and technological innovation.

They themselves do not have inherent magical abilities

Trakarians compensate with war machines and mech suits. 

We know that a lot of conflict arises from the Trakarians  

driving the K'ailantians out and mining 

Kalodium  the world resource.  

There exists a special lineage of K'ailantians known as the Kaidros. 

It translates literally to source bearer. 

One who can harness the raw power

 and energy of the astral realm. 

They are 10x more powerful than the average K'ailantian.

In the comics and animation 

We follow the story of Ava a young kaidro

as she discovers her identity and her powers. 

Itâ€™s a fun, and relatable

. You can read it now on webtoons.</p>
