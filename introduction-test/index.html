      <p> Kaidro the awakening is a one of a kind intellectual property
        That has three components - a comic, a game and an animated series. All these are meant to take its consumers on a fully immersive experience across an ever-expanding universe. The lore is set on the post-apocalyptic yet beautiful world of T'aljor. It is shrouded in the mists of ancient magic
        and technological wonders. In this world, Gaia is the deity and there are two races. The Trakarians and K'ailantians. The K'ailantians are revered for their innate connection to astral powers, them unparalleled abilities to manipulate the forces of the cosmos.
        They are like guardians of ancient wisdom and custodians of  spiritual balance within T'aljor. In contrast, the Trakarians have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and technological innovation.
        They themselves do not have inherent magical abilities. Trakarians compensate with war machines and mech suits. We know that a lot of conflict arises from the Trakarians driving the K'ailantians out and mining 
        Kalodium  the world resource. There exists a special lineage of K'ailantians known as the Kaidros. It translates literally to source bearer. One who can harness the raw power and energy of the astral realm. 
        They are 10x more powerful than the average K'ailantian. In the comics and animation We follow the story of Ava a young kaidro as she discovers her identity and her powers. 
        Itâ€™s a fun story. You can read it now completely on webtoons or in the kaidro.com website.</p>
